I want to learn java and use it to make games, game engines, and mods

One of my first ambitions is to create a game revolving around a futuristic horror shooter where the player fights hordes of creatures in the dark and is equipped only with a gun which is barely powerful enough to deter monsters, not harm them, a flare which when lit will burn for a few seconds, then fizzle out, providing light and scarring monsters, and soon after, a device which shoots flares, which can stick to enemies causeing them to run through the crowd and scarring other nearby creatures. Instead of players killing all the monsters in a horde, they run away using flares and other tools to deter them, or to scare the whole group away by repeatedly shooting, flashing, and exposing to deterrent chemicals similar to bear spray to make them unwilling to fight the player.

This will take years of work, and is what I have been aspiring to make for a while. 

UPDATE: I have changed from wanting to learn java to CSharp and I am going to jump on the aspiring unity developer bandwagon, but I will C++ so that I can learn the unreal engine and the source engine so that maybe I can get a job at Valve.

Another game I want to create is a game that I havent quite defined, all I know is it likely takes place in the vietnam war and will try to be a boomer shooter (a game that plays similarly to DOOM)
